Sure! Here's an idea for a mini project on web designing that utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB:

Project Idea: Online Recipe Manager

Description:
Create an online recipe manager that allows users to store and manage their favorite recipes. Users will be able to create an account, log in, add new recipes, view existing recipes, and search for recipes based on various criteria. The application will utilize HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and MongoDB for the backend to store and retrieve recipe data.

Features:

1. User Authentication:
   - User registration and login system.
   - Secure authentication using hashed passwords.

2. Recipe Management:
   - Allow users to add, edit, and delete recipes.
   - Each recipe should have a title, ingredients, instructions, and optional image.
   - Implement form validation to ensure all required fields are filled.

3. Recipe Search:
   - Implement a search functionality to find recipes based on keywords, ingredients, or categories.
   - Display search results dynamically without refreshing the page.

4. Categories and Tags:
   - Allow users to assign categories and tags to recipes for better organization and searching.
   - Implement a filter to display recipes by category or tag.

5. Responsive Design:
   - Ensure the application is mobile-friendly and works well on different screen sizes.
   - Use CSS media queries to adjust the layout based on the device's screen size.

6. Backend with MongoDB:
   - Use MongoDB as the database to store recipe data.
   - Connect to the MongoDB database using a backend framework like Node.js or Express.js.
   - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing recipes.

7. User-Friendly Interface:
   - Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using HTML and CSS.
   - Implement interactive features using JavaScript and libraries like jQuery.

Remember to break down the project into smaller tasks, plan your database structure, and wireframe the user interface before starting the implementation. This will help you stay organized and focused throughout the project. Good luck with your mini web design project!
